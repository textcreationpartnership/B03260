            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY To the Memory of the Right Houorable THOMAS Earl of OSSORY, Who departed this Life, <hi>July</hi> the 30th. 1680.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>LEt no man our officious haſt condemn,</l>
               <l>that we the loſs of ſo much worth proclaim</l>
               <l>Want of his ſervice ſoon had made it known,</l>
               <l>And we are ſure but juſt, the loſs to own.</l>
               <l>Since he is dead, there is no other way,</l>
               <l>Our Gratitude for his Deſerts to pay.</l>
               <l>In his Diſtemper every Man took part,</l>
               <l>For he had ſure a ſhare in every Heart.</l>
               <l>To every honeſt Man, moſt dear before,</l>
               <l>But by the unhappy loſs endear'd much more;</l>
               <l>For 'tis a natural Vice with mankind born,</l>
               <l>That ſtill the Good which we poſſeſs, we ſcorn.</l>
               <l>Never allowing Vertue paſt eſteem,</l>
               <l>Till the Grave ſnatch what we can nere redeem.</l>
               <l>Yet ſoon as we the mighty loſs ſuſtain,</l>
               <l>We pray, admire, and wiſh for it in vain;</l>
               <l>How would we value it, if we had'tagain.</l>
               <l>Juſt ſuch was every Engliſh mans concern,</l>
               <l>When of his Life they did the danger learn.</l>
               <l>Well might they love him; one ſo juſt and good,</l>
               <l>Much greater by his Vertues, than his Blood.</l>
               <l>Who juſtly ſtill ambition'd a good Name,</l>
               <l>Yet lov'd his Country, more than he loved Fame.</l>
               <l>No fear of Death could e're his Courage ſtay,</l>
               <l>Wherever dangerous Honour led the way;</l>
               <l>For this he left his Eaſe and plenty ſtill.</l>
               <l>His natural Valour high improv'd by Skill.</l>
               <l>Hardned by danger, and by conſtant pain.</l>
               <l>His Countries Good, his great, nay only Gain.</l>
               <l>For that ſuch wonders he in Fight has wrought,</l>
               <l>For that at Land and Sea ſo often Fought.</l>
               <l>Thoſe different Forms of War he made his own,</l>
               <l>And know both better, than moſt men do one.</l>
               <l>In this our Britiſh World our God of War,</l>
               <l>Great in his Martial-Acts, but greater far</l>
               <l>In his untainted and firm Loyalty.</l>
               <l>His conſtant and oft proved Fidelity</l>
               <l>What to his Prince, what to the People due,</l>
               <l>His honeſt Mind and ſearching Judgment knew.</l>
               <l>And what he knew, He ſtill to Act reduc'd</l>
               <l>Hating meer notions that were nere of Uſe.</l>
               <l>Betwixr theſe two ſo equally he moved,</l>
               <l>That he by both was equally beloved.</l>
               <l>A rare Example of a Worthy Lord,</l>
               <l>His Prinees Favour have, and Countries Word.</l>
               <l>And to his great and everlaſting pralſe,</l>
               <l>Even in theſe ſurly dark deſigning days;</l>
               <l>Theſe Times when moſt try openly their Skill</l>
               <l>In making Parties, He was honeſt ſtill.</l>
               <l>By feign'd Affronts ne're his Duty led,</l>
               <l>Baſe Faction for to Countenance or Hed</l>
               <l>Oh that our Lords would their loſt time Redeem,</l>
               <l>And not ſo much admire, as Copy him!</l>
               <l>Be good like Him, if they do like him be Great,</l>
               <l>And be his Peers in Vertue as in State.</l>
               <l>He whoſe great Worth all did ſo juſtly own,</l>
               <l>That Rivals in his Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had none.</l>
               <l>To all as their deſerts were, He was kind,</l>
               <l>Still with right Judgment and unbiaſt Mind;</l>
               <l>Great without Vanity, and without ends Juſt,</l>
               <l>Humble tho honoured, faithful when in Truſt.</l>
               <l>The dangerous fruits of too great Praiſes He</l>
               <l>Knew well, and to decline them till was free</l>
               <l>The new diſtraction preſently he knew,</l>
               <l>Love without Fear, Praiſe without Envy drew;</l>

               <l>Should we all reckon, we ſhould ne're give ore,</l>
               <l>But to Crown theſe and many Vertues more.</l>
               <l>His Love to our Religion ſtill was great,</l>
               <l>Which he profeſt not as a Trick of State.</l>
               <l>Leſt he ſhould Favour, or an Office want,</l>
               <l>His Life as well as Faith was Proteſtant.</l>
